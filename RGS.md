# Introduction




# Algorithm



# Methods

##	Open the layers you want to work with

###	Open a vector layer in QGIS: a Google Earth file (kml) or a shapefile (shp)

#####Open QGIS Desktop

#####Open the file (kml or shp):
-	From the “Manage Layers Toolbar” (printscreen on the left);

-	From the “Menu Toolbar” (printscreen on the right).

###	Open a csv file in QGIS


##	Once all the layers are in QGIS, check the projection


##	Random geo sampling in QGIS


###	You already have a dataset of identified points for the population you are investigating


####	Random geo sampling for the whole population that you are studying


####	Random geo sampling within subsets of the population that you are studying


####	Save the sample points created as a shapefile


###	You only have area boundaries within which you want to create random points


####	Unstratified random geo sampling for the whole population that you are studying


####	Stratified random geo sampling specifying number of points or density per stratum


####	Stratified random geo sampling within subsets using a column from the attribute table
